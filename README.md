# heart-disease-prediction

The objective of this project is to predict accurately the presence of heart disease. Develop machine learning model to predict future possibility of heart disease by implementing different classification algorithms for best results. To determine significant risk factors based on medical dataset which may lead to heart disease.

The approach is:

1. Problem definition
2. Data
3. Evaluation
4. Features
5. Modelling
6. Experimentation
